# Parsing Records: Head-to-Head Record Matrix Generator

## Overview

This Python script, `parsing_records.py`, is designed to generate a matrix of head-to-head win records for sports teams based on provided data. It leverages the pandas library for data manipulation and formatting, offering an efficient and readable way to visualize team performance against each other.

## Features

* **Data Parsing** : Converts JSON data into a structured matrix.
* **Matrix Generation** : Produces a head-to-head record matrix where each cell indicates the number of wins a team has against another.
* **Pandas Integration** : Uses pandas DataFrame for an efficient and user-friendly data structure.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* pandas library

## Installation

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed. You can install pandas using pip if it's not already installed:

```
pip install pandas

```

## File Description

`parsing_records.py` - The main script file that contains the function to generate the head-to-head matrix and a sample data set to demonstrate its usage.

### Function: `create_head_to_head_matrix(records_data)`

This function takes a dictionary of records data and generates a pandas DataFrame representing the head-to-head win records matrix.

#### Parameters:

* `records_data` (dict): A dictionary with team names as keys. Each key's value is another dictionary indicating wins ('W') and losses ('L') against other teams.

#### Returns:

* `pandas.DataFrame`: A DataFrame representing the head-to-head win record matrix.

## Usage

1. Prepare a JSON-like dictionary with your team records.
2. Call the `create_head_to_head_matrix` function with this dictionary.
3. The function returns a pandas DataFrame which you can display or process further.

### Example

```
records_data = {
    # Your records data here
}

matrix_df = create_head_to_head_matrix(records_data)
print(matrix_df)
```
